# Python Practice – Foundations for Data Analysis

This repository contains a collection of Python exercises and small programs developed to strengthen core programming skills relevant to data analysis and business problem-solving.

The focus is on **clear logic, data validation, and readable code**, rather than advanced algorithms or frameworks.

---

## What this repository demonstrates

- Python fundamentals (functions, loops, conditionals)
- String and numeric processing
- Input validation and edge case handling
- Problem decomposition and logical thinking
- Writing readable, maintainable Python code

These skills are directly applicable to tasks such as data cleaning, rule-based analysis, and preparing datasets for reporting and analytics.

---

## Repository structure

Each folder represents a focused exercise or problem, for example:

- Password strength evaluation
- Sequence analysis
- Unit conversion utilities
- Logical condition checks

The repository reflects consistent practice over time and incremental improvement in problem-solving approaches.

---

## Tools & technologies

- Python 3
- Standard Python libraries only (no external dependencies)

---

## Context

This repository is intended as a **foundational practice space** and complements my applied data analysis projects, which focus on real-world datasets, SQL, and business-oriented insights.

For applied analytics work, please see my other repositories.
